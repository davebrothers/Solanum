### Because Pomodoro.

It's a Winforms Pomodoro timer because I wanted one and don't you dare poopoo Winforms. They may not be sexy, but neither is this app.

### Highlights:
* It works. If it doesn't, let me know or submit a PR.
* It stays mostly out of your way. Except when the timer's done, because that's when you want it in your way. Nobody wants to miss breaks. Breaks are when you get coffee and snacks.
* It has keyboard shortcuts in case your mouse sucks or you're one of those people who thinks they like vim.

* Disclaimer: they might try to sell you things. You don't need timers that look like carmine fruit. Use my terrible software.
